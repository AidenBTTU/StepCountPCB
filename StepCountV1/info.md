The first version of this project. 

New Features: This version includes a boot switch, a BMA400 accelerometer, a micro USB connection, and pinned-out I2C communication pins for a connected Display 

Discovered Problems: The MCU being used in this project, the STM32F103C8T6 does not come with a bootloader that allows it to be flashed via USB. This rendered the original board unprogrammable in this edition.
